            <span><strong>Mostly I enjoy spending time with my family, watching my children grow, learn, and develop is one of the most rewarding factors in my life. Even the struggles and restraint I see in myself during
            parenting events can be its own reward seeing how i just want to give them a better life than I ever had. When I do get time to myself I enjoy playing video games, discovering pleasent tunes on my
            electric guitar, and ice cream!</strong></span> <br>
            <br>
            <span><strong>When I am finally retired from the navy I hope to find a job in programming. Any job in this field would be a joy. 
            This career change, I am hopeing, would bring stability to my family due to the flexibility in location and just being able to be home more to help guide my kids in life would be a god send. 
            My dream in the coding field would be to help work for a company that manages a massive multiplayer online game. 
            In my youth I always liked the comradery these types of games created for people and to be apart of the development or maintenance of that 
            would be pretty awesome. </strong></span> <br>
            <br>
            <span><strong>In the end though I always enjoyed building things (hence my time in the construction field of the Navy) and puzzles (my time in the explosive
            field of the Navy dealt with complex problems) and coding seems to be two in one.</strong></span>
